### What is good code?

1. Readable
2. Scalable (Big O) -

How long does it take to run a certain problem through a function or a task?
How can we measure big O, or the efficiency?

## Big O = in terms of effeciency, How long an algorithm takes to run

BigO and scalability means when we grow bigger and bigger with our input, How much does the algorithm slow down.
(Algorithmic Efficiency)
The less it slows down(the slower it slows down), the better it is.

Instead of using time to measure the efficiency of our function, we can just calculate how many operations a computer has to perform. Big O allows us and concerns us with how many steps it takes in a function.

Big O doesn’t measure things in seconds. Instead we’re focusing on **how quickly the runtime grows**.
The size of input compared to the number of operations that increase => scalability!

<Inputs can be any type of data>
- O(n) [O of n] - Linear Time (Proportionally)

- O(1) [O of one] - Constant time
  No matter how big the input is, the number of operations stays flat
  Predictability, in terms of computing, is very nice.
